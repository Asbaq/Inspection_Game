## 🛠️ Script Documentation

### 🎮 **CameraLook.cs**
Handles **camera movement and player rotation** based on mouse input.

```csharp
public class CameraLook : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float mouseSensitivity = 100f;
    public Transform playerBody;
    float xRotation = 0f;

    void Update()
    {
        float mouseX = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal2") * mouseSensitivity * Time.deltaTime;
        float mouseY = Input.GetAxis("Vertical2") * mouseSensitivity * Time.deltaTime;

        xRotation -= mouseY;
        xRotation = Mathf.Clamp(xRotation, -90f, 90f);

        transform.localRotation = Quaternion.Euler(xRotation, 0f, 0f);
        playerBody.Rotate(Vector3.up * mouseX);
    }
}
```

### 🎮 **Game_Manager.cs**
Manages **UI elements** and player interactions with the game.

```csharp
public class Game_Manager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public GameObject Canvas;

    void Update()
    {
        float x = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
        float z = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");

        Vector3 move = transform.right * x + transform.forward * z;

        controller.Move(move * speed * Time.deltaTime);
    }
}
```
